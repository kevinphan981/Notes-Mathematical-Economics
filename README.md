# About

These sets of notes (written in LaTeX for the most part) are from the courses that I've taken and any small snippets of
information that I have learned during my time studying Mathematics and Economics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
**These notes do not include things about econometrics or statistics**, there are much more mathematical components to economics than just what 
I have mentioned.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
I assume that the reader has a knowledge of basic Calculus (the single and multivariate level) as the texts cover 
derivatives, partial derivaitives and minima/maxima with concavity. It would also be best to have a good intuition 
of economics (the introductory level you would find in Mankiw is fine), as we will be discussing things like consumption bundles
and basic macroeconomic models.
